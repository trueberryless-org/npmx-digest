      "title": "Dependency Pinning and Security Hardening",
      "summary": "Implemented a major security and stability update by pinning all core development and production dependencies to exact versions. This transition, managed via Renovate, ensures deterministic builds and mitigates risks associated with breaking upstream changes in packages like UnoCSS, TypeScript, and Vite-PWA. Furthermore, the project officially enabled security advisories with the addition of SECURITY.md.",

The update ensures the 'dependencies' column remains visible even when the count is zero to prevent layout shifts and improve user orientation. Logic was also added to right-align terminal columns for a more balanced grid structure.",
