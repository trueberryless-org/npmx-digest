      "summary": "The internationalization framework has been overhauled to support multiple JSON files and country variants (e.g., es-ES and es-419). New Japanese translations were added, and translation progress is now surfaced directly in the UI via Lunaria integration. Hardcoded strings across components were externalized to en.json for full translatability.",
