      "title": "Routing Architecture: Canonical Schema & Redirects",
      "summary": "Implemented a significant overhaul of the platform's URL structure to establish a new canonical routing schema (e.g., transitioning from `/{name}` to `/package/{name}`). This update resolves routing conflicts with reserved names like 'search', configures trailing slash normalization via Vercel, and provides a clear path for upcoming sections like sponsors, tools, and reports.",

Core UI elements like toggles and switches received border refinements for better visibility, and missing semantic headers (h1) were added to the search page for screen reader clarity.",
